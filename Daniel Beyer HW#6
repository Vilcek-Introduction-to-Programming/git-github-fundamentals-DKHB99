I did not know github was a thing so it was interesting to see that there is a database for R which you can track changes and work with others on code. I'm still a bit confused on how to do things like starting my own repository or inviting others to work on the repository.

Some of the tools Wilson et. al recommends for collaboration are having a project overview and deciding on communication strategies. Github is very convenient for this, as a document named README in a repository can serve as the project overview, and comits/pull requests can help make communicating between workers easier.
